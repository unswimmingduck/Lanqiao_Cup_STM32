&emsp;&emsp; In 2022, I anticipated in Shanghai Division of Lanqiao Cup Embedded Group Competition. In this competition, we are required to finish five to six function using the peripheral in STM32G431 
,such as: LCD, Usart, Key, I2C, TIM, ADC, Input capture and so on, in a limited time. At the last, I won the Second Prize in Shanghai Division of Lanqiao Cup Embedded Group Competition, the certification 
of the prize is below.  
&emsp;&emsp; **What's more, to got better result in the competition, I also do lots of preperation ahead of the competition. In the ```./training_code```, you can see the project I did ahead of the competition.**
